# 🩺 AI-Based Diabetes Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
Diabetes is a chronic disease that can lead to severe health complications if not detected early. This project presents an AI-based machine learning system designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes using key medical and demographic parameters. The system supports early diagnosis and aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being).
